
This is a simple HTML document with CSS to create markers with different colors.

To use, follow these steps:

Save the HTML code in a file with .html extension.
Save the CSS code in a file with .css extension.
Include the CSS file in the HTML file by adding this line:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> 4. Open HTML file in a web browser.
The CSS code includes three classes for creating colored markers. Each class has a background color.

The HTML file includes a header, a main section with a container that holds three marker elements with class names "red", "green", and "blue."

The CSS code styles the header, main, container, marker, cap, and sleeve elements. The marker elements have a fixed width and height, and the cap and sleeve elements are displayed inline blocks.

With these styles, the marker elements will be displayed as colored markers with a cap and shaded sleeve.
